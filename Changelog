A quad port SFP+ card is unnecessary.

- I won't be needing independent 10 gigabit connections for each VM.
- The dual port NIC I have supports SR-IOV in case I want to pass through a port to a VM.
- The motherboard I have has two onboard 10 gigabit NICs

## 3-14-2022
TrueNAS Scale is being replaced with TrueNAS Core.

- The `apt` package manager is disabled from the command line.
- Clustering features using `gluster` requires a paid license to TrueCommand
- Clustering features don't yet have a GUI.
- If I want to make a cluster I'll need a third box, and that's not currently in the budget.

While the primary NAS may need some bells and whistles the backup NAS can be a simple appliance.  I can sell the Mini and replace it with a Synology NAS using the same drives.  Also installed a 2U mounting plate in the rack for the Pi cluster.
